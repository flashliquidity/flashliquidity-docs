# Flash loans

{% hint style="success" %}
Flash Loans allow you to borrow any available amount of assets without putting up any collateral, as long as the liquidity is returned to the protocol within one block transaction.
{% endhint %}

* Arbitrage farms contracts can lend out up to the entire rewards token balance in flash loan operations.
* flashLoan() function allows borrower to access liquidity of flash swaps farms reward token balance.
* 0.005% fees. (Generates yield for the arbitrage profits deposited into farms)
* NOTE: _flash loan fee_ is waived for approved addresses (zero fee flash loans)
* After some sanity checks, the Farm transfers the requested amounts of the reward token balance to your contract, then calls onFlashLoan() on receiver contract.
