# FLIQ Farms

FLIQ farms contracts distribute [FLIQ](../fliq-token.md) tokens (for an extendable period of time and at a fixed rate every second) to liquidity providers staking their token in the FLIQ liquidity mining Farms section of the FlashLiquidity Interface.

FLIQ reward rate can be changed as well (reduced or increased) while the reward distribution period can only be extended.

{% hint style="info" %}
Farms with distribution period still ongoing will be marked as 'Running' opposed to 'Closed' ones.
{% endhint %}
