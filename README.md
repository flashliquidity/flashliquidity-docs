**AMM and Liquidity Pools terminology** are heavily used **** in the following paragraphs make sure to have a basic understanding of the subjects before diving further in this docs.

### Brief introduction:

FlashLiquidity is built upon the [uniswap-v2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core) liquidity pools technology with liquidity providers sharing the 0.25% trading volume fee as incentive.

In addition to this every**\*** liquidity pool is paired one-on-one with a verified, non-upgradable smart contract called 'FlashBot' which is the only address authorized to swap tokens and periodically performs [Flash Swaps](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/guides/smart-contract-integration/using-flash-swaps) between the assigned FlashLiquidity pool and others decentralized exchanges running on Polygon network (Quickswap, Sushiswap and many others).

Flash swaps profits are distributed to liquidity providers staking their [LP tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) in the [Flash Swaps Farm](https://www.flashliquidity.finance/#/farm/flashswap) section of the [FlashLiquidity Interface](https://www.flashliquidity.finance/#/farm/flashswap)[.](https://www.flashliquidity.finance)

Alternatively liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens in the [FLIQ Farms ](fundamentals/farms/fliq-farms.md)section to receive [FLIQ](fundamentals/fliq-token.md) tokens at a fixed rate per second (proportionally to their share of liquidity staked vs total liquidity staked).&#x20;

To get started just add liquidity to one of the pools of your choice and stake your LP tokens to receive a share of both token swap fees, flash swaps profits AND/OR FLIQ tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
(**\***) Currently only pairs composed by 18 decimals token support automated flashswaps (new pair that will not meet this requirement will remain open for public trading but can still be included in the FLIQ liquidity mining program).
