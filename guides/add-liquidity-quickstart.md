# Add Liquidity Quickstart

## Liquidity provision

To add liquidity in one of the FlashLiquidity pools or even create a new one you need first to possess some tokens in your wallet connected to a FlashLiquidity supported blockchain.

Most centralized exchanges offer direct tokens withdrawal with low fees.

Once you have some tokens in your wallet connected to the supported chain of choice you can swap thoose tokens on FlashLiquidity to other assets.

After thoose steps you should now possess the desired tokens to provide liquidity in one of the FlashLiquidity pools or even create a new one.
