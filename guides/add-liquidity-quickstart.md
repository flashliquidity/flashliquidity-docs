# Add Liquidity Quickstart

## Liquidity provision

To add liquidity in one of the FlashLiquidity pools or even create a new one you need first to possess some tokens in your Metamask wallet connected to Polygon blockchain.

Centralized Exchanges like [Binance](https://www.binance.com) and [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com) offer direct Matic tokens withdrawal to the Polygon Pos chain with low fees.

Alternatively you could use [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange) fiat-on-ramp options to buy Matic tokens (directly on Polygon chain) with SEPA deposits or credit card.

Once you have some Matic tokens in your Metamask wallet connected to the Polygon chain you can swap thoose tokens to other assets of your choice in one of the many AMMs running on Polygon (Quickswap,Sushiswap,Apeswap,DFYN).

After thoose steps you should now possess the desired tokens to provide liquidity in one of the FlashLiquidity pools or even create a new one.
