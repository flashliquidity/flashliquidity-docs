# Add Liquidity Quickstart

## Liquidity provision

To add liquidity in one of the FlashLiquidity pools or even create a new one you need first to possess some tokens in your Metamask wallet connected to Polygon blockchain.

Most centralized exchanges offer direct Matic tokens withdrawal to the Polygon Pos chain with low fees.

Once you have some Matic tokens in your Metamask wallet connected to the Polygon chain you can swap thoose tokens on FlashLiquidity to other assets of your choice or on one of the many AMMs running on Polygon PoS chain.

After thoose steps you should now possess the desired tokens to provide liquidity in one of the FlashLiquidity pools or even create a new one.
