# SBP Vaults Quickstart

### Staking LP tokens

[FlashLiquidity farming options](broken-reference)

After [providing liquidity](add-liquidity-quickstart.md) in one of the Flashliquidity pools presents in the Self-balancing section of FlashLiquidity Dapp you should now possess LP tokens proportional to the amounts of the tokens deposited in the pool.

You can now stake these LP tokens in the corresponding vault of the Self-balancing section using the deposit button and start earning a share of the arbitrage profits.
